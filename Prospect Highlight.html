			<h2>Prospects</h2>
			<p>Prospects throughout an MLB team's organization arre crucial to the continued success of the team. Fans rely on the organization to draft and train players that can succeed at every level. The San Francisco Giants have five professional affiliates that are associated witrh the team. These are the major league team, the AAA Sacramento River Cats, the AA Richmond Flying Squirrels, the High-A Eugene Emerals, and the Low-A San Jose Giants. Throughout all of these teams, the Giants have players that can move up and down according to performance.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Kyle Harrison is a left handed pitcher currently on the AAA roster for the Sacramento River Cats.</li>
				<li>Harrison has put up a 3.00 era for the start of the season. This causes some concern but the hope is that he works out kinks within his windup.</li>
				<li>With the rate that he is going, Harrison should make it to the major league roster by the end of this season.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Marco Luciano is a shortstop currently on the AA roster for the Richmond Flying Squirrels.</li>
				<li>Luciano has moved up the ranks due to excellent performance, but has recently slowed down offensive production.</li>
				<li>If Luciano turns out to be what the Giants have hoped he would be, the organization has a bright future.</li>

				<li>Ramos has played well when given the chance, he has just hasn't yet had the opporotunity to have consistent playing time.</li>
				<li>Ramos's powerful swing is something taht the Giants hope to unlock as he moved futher on in his career.</li>
